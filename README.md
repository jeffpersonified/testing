#Hpstrly
==========

Hpstrly is an analog url shortner. Style your links with the most obscure of hipster terminology. Dig it.

This was the first rails app I deployed while going through [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) Fall 2012. 

The live site can be found at [hpstr.ly](http://hpstrly.herokuapp.com).

##To Do
==========
* Add index to short_urls column
* Add favicon
* Switch url columns on index
